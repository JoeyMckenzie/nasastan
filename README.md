# NASAStan üöÄ

A PHPStan extension that enforces
NASA's [Power of Ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code)
rules in your PHP code.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is solely for self-learning and under active development. You're on your own if you it for the time being.

## Why should I use this extension?

Great question. I'm still trying to figure out an answer to that myself.

## Installation

To get started, install the package with composer:

```
composer require --dev joeymckenzie/nasastan
```

## Usage

If you're using `phpstan/extension-installer`, you're all set!

If not, however, include the extension in your PHPStan configuration:

```yaml
includes:
  - vendor/joeymckenzie/nasastan/extension.neon
```

## Original NASA Power of Ten Rules

1. Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.
2. All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
3. Avoid heap memory allocation after initialization.
4. Restrict functions to a single printed page.
5. Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.
6. Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
7. Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.
8. Use the preprocessor only for header files and simple macros.
9. Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.
10. Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.

## Rules

### Rule 1

#### Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.

Disallows the use of `goto` statements and recursive functions. The following code would be in direct violation of this
rule and reported on by NASAStan:

```php
// ‚ùå Bad
function baz(): void
{
    start:
    $foo = 'bar';

    goto start;  // phpstan: NASA Power of Ten Rule #1: Goto statements are not allowed.
}

function factorial(int $n): int
{
    if ($n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    return $n * factorial($n - 1); // phpstan: NASA Power of Ten Rule #1: Recursive method calls are not allowed. 
}
```
